this is a project file base on e-garage django project.

here I made project file Apps for some dummy project.

There is crudfunc app which implement CRUD operation for models in database.

In employee app there is create and list views are there.

Generic app is for abstract class which won't be migrated in models (There is BaseField only.)

In home app there is nothing much only redirecting urls.

In obj app there is nothing much.

In order app there is two createview in views.py and two models in models.py

In userapp app there is abstractuser in models.py and also there is forms.py in there, views.py is right now untouched.
Above work is done.

And also learnt to send email and how to create pie chart.
